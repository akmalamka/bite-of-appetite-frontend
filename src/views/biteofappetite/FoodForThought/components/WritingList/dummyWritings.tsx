    story:
      'When the days become colder, I immediately crave sot-bap. Sot-bap in Korean merely translates to pot-rice. What`s beautiful about pot rice is that there can be thousands of variations depending on what toppings your heart desires. You can put vegetables, protein, seafood, anything imaginable. You`ll be rewarded with delicately steamed toppings strawn on top of freshly steamed rice that absorbed all the nuances of your desired toppings. \n Since mushrooms are now in season, I made buseot sot bap, aka mushroom pot rice. This is personally my favorite pot rice. While most mushrooms are available year-round, foraged during the colder seasons are the peak of woodiness and earthiness. ',

Nothing beats gathering loved ones around a mountain of these freshly fried treats and biting into the hot chewy-crispy swirls straight out of the fryer. \n These South Asian treats look intimidatingly beautiful, but jalebi are simple to make. Don’t let the deep-frying deter you—wintery days are the ideal time to turn on the stove and go on a jalebi journey. The urad dal (ivory white lentil) powder in the batter helps the jalebi stay crisp no matter how long they soak in the cardamom-rose syrup. Not a fan of rose? Feel free to flavor your syrup with warm spices or some orange-flower water. Whatever you do, just don’t forget the lemon juice; it prevents the syrup from crystallizing while your jalebi soak it all up.',

      'This pavlova recipe is all about achieving that perfect range of textures, where velvety dollops of whipped cream top a crisp, delicate meringue shell made extra crunchy by the addition of nuts or poppyseeds before baking. Technique is key here: Heating the sugar before beating it into the egg whites creates an extra-glossy, stable meringue and using a wooden spoon to prop the oven door open just a smidge while the meringues cool helps ensure they won’t collapse. A few cracks are common; simply cover them with the whipped cream and berries—or passion fruit and mango if you prefer tropical fruit flavors. Yielding 12 individual meringues, this recipe is ideal for those of us tired of loved ones trying to hog our dessert: Everyone gets their own.',

Dark brown sugar is key (keeping the bread ultra tender and moist), and a dollop of mascarpone (which you can sub with sour cream or yogurt if desired) makes for superior tenderness in the crumb. Chocolate and walnuts are optional but encouraged, and if you like an extra crunch, follow former BA test kitchen director and cookbook author Carla Lalli Music’s recommendation and sprinkle the top with raw sugar just before you put the pan in the oven.

      'This pavlova recipe is all about achieving that perfect range of textures, where velvety dollops of whipped cream top a crisp, delicate meringue shell made extra crunchy by the addition of nuts or poppyseeds before baking. Technique is key here: Heating the sugar before beating it into the egg whites creates an extra-glossy, stable meringue and using a wooden spoon to prop the oven door open just a smidge while the meringues cool helps ensure they won’t collapse. A few cracks are common; simply cover them with the whipped cream and berries—or passion fruit and mango if you prefer tropical fruit flavors. Yielding 12 individual meringues, this recipe is ideal for those of us tired of loved ones trying to hog our dessert: Everyone gets their own.',

      'As a child, I would watch in wide-eyed wonder as my mom lifted one jalebi after another out of the frying pan, forming mouthwatering piles of orange spirals. Nothing beats gathering loved ones around a mountain of these freshly fried treats and biting into the hot chewy-crispy swirls straight out of the fryer. \n These South Asian treats look intimidatingly beautiful, but jalebi are simple to make. Don’t let the deep-frying deter you—wintery days are the ideal time to turn on the stove and go on a jalebi journey. The urad dal (ivory white lentil) powder in the batter helps the jalebi stay crisp no matter how long they soak in the cardamom-rose syrup. Not a fan of rose? Feel free to flavor your syrup with warm spices or some orange-flower water. Whatever you do, just don’t forget the lemon juice; it prevents the syrup from crystallizing while your jalebi soak it all up.',

      'When the days become colder, I immediately crave sot-bap. Sot-bap in Korean merely translates to pot-rice. What`s beautiful about pot rice is that there can be thousands of variations depending on what toppings your heart desires. You can put vegetables, protein, seafood, anything imaginable. You`ll be rewarded with delicately steamed toppings strawn on top of freshly steamed rice that absorbed all the nuances of your desired toppings. \n Since mushrooms are now in season, I made buseot sot bap, aka mushroom pot rice. This is personally my favorite pot rice. While most mushrooms are available year-round, foraged during the colder seasons are the peak of woodiness and earthiness. ',

      'This pavlova recipe is all about achieving that perfect range of textures, where velvety dollops of whipped cream top a crisp, delicate meringue shell made extra crunchy by the addition of nuts or poppyseeds before baking. Technique is key here: Heating the sugar before beating it into the egg whites creates an extra-glossy, stable meringue and using a wooden spoon to prop the oven door open just a smidge while the meringues cool helps ensure they won’t collapse. A few cracks are common; simply cover them with the whipped cream and berries—or passion fruit and mango if you prefer tropical fruit flavors. Yielding 12 individual meringues, this recipe is ideal for those of us tired of loved ones trying to hog our dessert: Everyone gets their own.',

      'When the days become colder, I immediately crave sot-bap. Sot-bap in Korean merely translates to pot-rice. What`s beautiful about pot rice is that there can be thousands of variations depending on what toppings your heart desires. You can put vegetables, protein, seafood, anything imaginable. You`ll be rewarded with delicately steamed toppings strawn on top of freshly steamed rice that absorbed all the nuances of your desired toppings. \n Since mushrooms are now in season, I made buseot sot bap, aka mushroom pot rice. This is personally my favorite pot rice. While most mushrooms are available year-round, foraged during the colder seasons are the peak of woodiness and earthiness. ',

Nothing beats gathering loved ones around a mountain of these freshly fried treats and biting into the hot chewy-crispy swirls straight out of the fryer. \n These South Asian treats look intimidatingly beautiful, but jalebi are simple to make. Don’t let the deep-frying deter you—wintery days are the ideal time to turn on the stove and go on a jalebi journey. The urad dal (ivory white lentil) powder in the batter helps the jalebi stay crisp no matter how long they soak in the cardamom-rose syrup. Not a fan of rose? Feel free to flavor your syrup with warm spices or some orange-flower water. Whatever you do, just don’t forget the lemon juice; it prevents the syrup from crystallizing while your jalebi soak it all up.',

      'This pavlova recipe is all about achieving that perfect range of textures, where velvety dollops of whipped cream top a crisp, delicate meringue shell made extra crunchy by the addition of nuts or poppyseeds before baking. Technique is key here: Heating the sugar before beating it into the egg whites creates an extra-glossy, stable meringue and using a wooden spoon to prop the oven door open just a smidge while the meringues cool helps ensure they won’t collapse. A few cracks are common; simply cover them with the whipped cream and berries—or passion fruit and mango if you prefer tropical fruit flavors. Yielding 12 individual meringues, this recipe is ideal for those of us tired of loved ones trying to hog our dessert: Everyone gets their own.',

      'As a child, I would watch in wide-eyed wonder as my mom lifted one jalebi after another out of the frying pan, forming mouthwatering piles of orange spirals. Nothing beats gathering loved ones around a mountain of these freshly fried treats and biting into the hot chewy-crispy swirls straight out of the fryer. \n These South Asian treats look intimidatingly beautiful, but jalebi are simple to make. Don’t let the deep-frying deter you—wintery days are the ideal time to turn on the stove and go on a jalebi journey. The urad dal (ivory white lentil) powder in the batter helps the jalebi stay crisp no matter how long they soak in the cardamom-rose syrup. Not a fan of rose? Feel free to flavor your syrup with warm spices or some orange-flower water. Whatever you do, just don’t forget the lemon juice; it prevents the syrup from crystallizing while your jalebi soak it all up.',
